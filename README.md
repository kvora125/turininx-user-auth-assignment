# Auth0 Next.js SDK Based User Authentication SPA:

This Web App demonstrates the integration of [Auth0 Next.js SDK](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0) into a Next.js application created using [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).

This Web app demonstrates the following use cases:

- [Login](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/components/NavBar.jsx#L61-L67)
- [Logout](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/components/NavBar.jsx#L93-L95)
- [Showing the user profile](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/pages/profile.jsx)

## Project setup

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration (Optional - try only if you know Auth0 well and want to test app in your own Auth0 env)

### Create an API

For the **External API** page to work, you will need to [create an API](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/apis) using the [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis). This will give you an API Identifier that you can use in the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` environment variable below. Then you will need to [add a permission](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/dashboard/add-api-permissions) named `read:shows` to your API. To get your app to ask for that permission, include it in the value of the `AUTH0_SCOPE` environment variable.

If you do not wish to use an API or observe the API call working, you should not specify the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` and `AUTH0_SCOPE` values in the next steps.

### Configure credentials

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 Domain, Client ID and Client Secret for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy below code into a new file in the root folder called `.env.local`, and replace the values with your own Auth0 application credentials (see more info about [loading environmental variables in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)):

```sh
# A long secret value used to encrypt the session cookie
AUTH0_SECRET='LONG_RANDOM_VALUE'
# The base url of your application
AUTH0_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'
# The url of your Auth0 tenant domain
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL='https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN.auth0.com'
# Your Auth0 application's Client ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'
# Your Auth0 application's Client Secret
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET'
# Your Auth0 API's Identifier 
# OMIT if you do not want to use the API part of the sample
AUTH0_AUDIENCE='YOUR_AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER'
# The permissions your app is asking for
# OMIT if you do not want to use the API part of the sample
AUTH0_SCOPE='openid profile email read:shows'
```

**Note**: Make sure you replace `AUTH0_SECRET` with your own secret (you can generate a suitable string using `openssl rand -hex 32` on the command line).

## Run the sample

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the Next.js app and starts the API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run the unit tests

```bash
npm run test
```
